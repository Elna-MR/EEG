1.Study introduction:
First, participants underwent a series of laser stimulations of varying intensities. The experimenter determined the energy intensity corresponding to an average score of 7 points among the participants. Subsequently, each participant received a fixed-intensity laser stimulation approximately every 20 seconds, for a total of 16 trials, during which they provided pain ratings ranging from 0 to 10. A rating of 0 indicated no sensation, 4 denoted the onset of pain perception, 6 represented moderate pain, 8 indicated severe pain, and 10 signified intolerable pain.
2.Participant task information(description of the experiment): 
Participants received laser stimulation and used a computer mouse to click on the appropriate position on the screen, corresponding to a scale of 0 to 10.
3.Participant instructions(as exact as possible):
Participants were instructed to concentrate on the laser stimuli, maintain open eyes, and fixate their gaze on a cross displayed on the screen before them.  Following the presentation of each laser stimulus, there was a pause of 3¨C5 seconds.  Subsequently, participants orally rated the intensity of pain within a time window of 3¨C5 seconds for each rating.  The subsequent trial commenced randomly within 1¨C3 seconds after the ratings were provided.
